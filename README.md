⏳ Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics

This project is a Chrome Extension designed to help users track the amount of time they spend on websites and analyze their daily productivity habits. By monitoring browsing behavior in real time, the extension provides actionable insights into how users allocate time across productive and non-productive activities. It empowers individuals, students, and professionals to improve their focus, reduce distractions, and build better digital work habits.

The Time Tracking & Productivity Analytics Chrome Extension automatically records how long a user spends on active browser tabs and categorizes websites based on productivity. With clean UI panels and visual reports, users can monitor their digital behavior with ease. The extension runs in the background, tracks active time even when switching tabs, and displays detailed analytics through popup dashboards or a dedicated options page.

This tool is especially helpful for users who want to manage screen time, reduce distractions (such as social media), or measure how long they spend on work-related platforms (like learning portals, coding sites, or emails). By leveraging Chrome's APIs, this extension works seamlessly without affecting browser performance.

🎯 Purpose of the Project
